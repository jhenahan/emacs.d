* Emacs Configuration in an Org file
  I've declared Emacs config bankruptcy for the new year, and it couldn't have
  come at a better time. All at once there are a bunch of new tools for
  Emacs configuration: =use-package= (and =req-package=, used here) and
  =bind-key= simplify a lot of the annoying bits. Dependency management was hard
  before Emacs 24, but with these new tools we can vastly simplify the process.
  We even get a simpler keybinding mechanism in the bargain.

* Package Management with Pallet
  [[https://github.com/rdallasgray/pallet][Pallet]] is a wonderful little tool built on [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]], a dependency management tool
  for Emacs packages. Pallet adds automatic updating of the =Caskfile= when
  packages are installed and deleted.

** Installing Cask
   Just run this command in your terminal of choice:

   #+NAME: Cask Installation
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     $ curl -fsSkL https://raw.github.com/cask/cask/master/go | python
   #+END_SRC

   then add =~/.cask/bin= to your =PATH= so that you can use =cask=.

** Creating a Caskfile
   For now, we just need a minimal =Cask= to get Pallet set up. Mine looks
   like this:

   #+NAME: Cask
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (source gnu)
     (source melpa)
     
     (depends-on "pallet")
     (depends-on "req-package")
     (depends-on "moe-theme")
     (depends-on "evil")
   #+END_SRC

   Then run the following command in your =.emacs.d= directory to set up Pallet:

   #+NAME: Cask Initialization
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cask install
   #+END_SRC

** Initialize Cask
   Finally, we add the following lines to our init file:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
     (require 'cask "~/.cask/cask.el")
     (cask-initialize)
   #+END_SRC

* Dependency Management with =req-package=
  [[https://github.com/edvorg/req-package][req-package]] is a wrapper on top of [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], a package dependency
  management tool. The documentation for =use-package= is immensely helpful for
  figuring out how to describe package dependencies and settings. =req-package=
  adds the =:require= keyword which allows us to define dependencies between
  related packages. 
** Initialize =req-package=
   With the preceding process complete, we just need to add the following line
   to our init file to begin using =req-package=:

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'req-package)
     (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
     (load custom-file)
   #+END_SRC

* Keybindings with =bind-key=
  There are a number of ways to bind keys in Emacs, but I find
  =bind-key=, bundled with =use-package=, easier to work with and,
  more importantly, easier to read. =bind-key= takes a key sequence, a
  command, and an optional keymap.  =bind-key*= overrides any minor
  mode which sets the keybinding. =unbind-key= takes a key sequence
  and a keymap and removes that binding. Invoking
  =describe-personal-keybindings= prints a summary of your keybindings
  through =bind-key= and any overrides or conflicts. This is really
  the killer convenience of using =bind-key=.

* Evil
  I was a diehard Vim user for a long time, and I still prefer the Vim way of
  interacting with text. [[https://gitorious.org/evil/pages/Home][Evil]] is a (mostly feature-complete) Vim emulation mode
  for Emacs. It has sane defaults and I rarely find weirdness or lacking
  features.

** =evil=
   Here we have our first package with dependencies. Historically, I've had
   little annoyances when =evil= loads before =evil-leader=, so we'll make sure
   it gets loaded first. By default, =evil= uses its own cursor which shows up
   black regardless of face settings. Setting =evil-default-cursor= lets us use
   the cursor we're used to. I also redefine a couple of =ex= commands for
   convenience.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package evil
       :ensure evil
       :requires (evil-leader helm-config evil-numbers
                              undo-tree surround ace-jump-mode)
       :init
       (progn
         (setq evil-default-cursor t)
         (evil-mode 1)
         (evil-ex-define-cmd "e[dit]" 'helm-find-files)
         (evil-ex-define-cmd "b[uffer]" 'helm-buffers-list)
         (bind-key "[escape]" 'keyboard-escape-quit evil-normal-state-map)
         (bind-key "[escape]" 'keyboard-escape-quit evil-visual-state-map)
         (bind-key "<escape>" 'keyboard-escape-quit)
         (setq evil-motion-state-modes
               (append evil-emacs-state-modes evil-motion-state-modes))
         (setq evil-emacs-state-modes '(magit-mode dired-mode))
         (bind-key "\"" 'ace-jump-mode evil-normal-state-map)))
   #+END_SRC

*** =evil-leader=
    =<leader>= is a really useful shorthand in Vim, and [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-leader][evil-leader]] brings the
    same facility to Evil. For really common commands, leader bindings can save
    those precious keystrokes.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (req-package evil-leader
                   :ensure evil-leader
                   :requires evil
                   :init
                   (progn
                     (evil-leader/set-leader "<SPC>")
                     (global-evil-leader-mode 1)
                     (evil-leader/set-key
                       "l" 'org-insert-link
                       "o" 'other-window
                       "d" 'delete-window
                       "D" 'delete-other-windows
                       "h" 'split-window-below
                       "v" 'split-window-right
                       "k" 'kill-buffer
                       "K" 'kill-buffer-and-window
                       "f" 'dired
                       "gs" 'magit-status)))
    #+END_SRC

*** =evil-numbers=
    One of the little Vim conveniences not found in vanilla Evil is incrementing
    and decrementing numbers with =C-a= and =C-x=, respectively, likely because
    these are already important bindings in Emacs. However, by limiting the
    effect to normal mode, we can use [[https://github.com/cofi/evil-numbers][evil-numbers]] to bring this functionality
    back without stomping all over existing bindings.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (req-package evil-numbers
                   :ensure evil-numbers
                   :requires evil
                   :config
                   (progn
                     (bind-key "C-a" 'evil-numbers/inc-at-pt evil-normal-state-map)
                     (bind-key "C-x" 'evil-numbers/dec-at-pt evil-normal-state-map)))
    #+END_SRC

*** =evil-surround=
    Working with delimiter pairs is common enough that Tim Pope wrote a plugin
    to ease working with them in Vim, called [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][vim-surround]]. [[https://github.com/timcharper/evil-surround][evil-surround]]
    emulates this functionality in =evil=. It's quite extensible, but the
    defaults seem to cover all my needs. Check out the README for some examples.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (req-package surround
                   :ensure surround
                   :init (global-surround-mode 1))
    #+END_SRC

*** =undo-tree=
    Standard Emacs undo is kind of confusing. [[http://www.dr-qubit.org/emacs.php#undo-tree][undo-tree]] replaces this with a
    simpler tree structure. It also allows us to visualize the tree directly.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (req-package undo-tree
                   :ensure undo-tree
                   :diminish ""
                   :init
                   (progn
                     (setq undo-tree-auto-save-history t)
                     (global-undo-tree-mode)))    
    #+END_SRC
    
*** =ace-jump-mode=
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (req-package ace-jump-mode)
    #+END_SRC

* Helm 
  Coming from Vim, I was very used to the fuzzy matching of CtrlP. [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings][Ido]] is a
  popular choice when one wishes to add this functionality to Emacs since it is
  built in and there is a fairly significant ecosystem built around it. I used
  Ido for a while, but after experimenting with [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]], I've decided to migrate.
  Think of Helm as CtrlP for every minibuffer. From describing functions and
  variables to interacting with =org=, Helm covers just about anything.

** =helm=
   Helm offers a command called =helm-mini= that opens a =helm= buffer populated
   with recent files and currently open buffers. I want Helm everywhere, so
   instead we'll activate =helm-mode= and work from there.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package helm-config
       :ensure helm
       :requires popwin
       :diminish (helm-mode . "")
       :init
       (progn
         (setq helm-ff-auto-update-initial-value)
         (setq popwin:special-display-config
               (append helm-popwin
                       popwin:special-display-config))
         (bind-key* "M-x" 'helm-M-x)
         (bind-key* "C-x C-f" 'helm-find-files))
       :config
       (helm-mode 1))
   #+END_SRC

** =popwin=
   The one annoying thing about =helm= is that the window it opens to show
   results is kinda huge. I use [[https://github.com/m2ym/popwin-el][popwin]] to limit the height of most of the
   Helm buffers.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package popwin
       :init
       (progn
         (popwin-mode 1)
         (setq helm-popwin
               '(("*Helm Find Files*" :height 10)
                 ("^\*helm.+\*$" :regexp t :height 10)))))
   #+END_SRC

* Org
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (req-package org
      :config
      (progn
        (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
                  '(lambda ()
                     (setq mode-name " ꙮ ")))
        (bind-key* "C-c c" 'org-capture)
        (bind-key* "C-c l" 'org-store-link)
        (bind-key* "C-c a" 'org-agenda)
        (bind-key* "C-c b" 'org-iswitch)))
  #+END_SRC

* UI
  I'm pretty picky about how I want my editor to look, so there's a fair bit of
  configuration that goes here.

** Theme
   I've switched entirely to dark themes to make working with
   Structured Haskell Mode easier, and I like the colors of
   [[https://github.com/kuanyui/moe-theme.el][moe-theme]]. It's bright and has good default faces for most
   modes. It also has dark and light versions, which is convenient.
   
   I also advise =load-theme= to fully unload the previous theme
   before loading a new one.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defadvice load-theme 
       (before theme-dont-propagate activate)
       (mapc #'disable-theme custom-enabled-themes))

     (req-package moe-theme
       :requires powerline
       :init
       (moe-dark)
       :config
       (progn
         (defun moe-stuff (&rest frame)
           (powerline-moe-theme)
           (moe-theme-random-color))
         (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'moe-stuff t)))
   #+END_SRC

** Modeline
   Powerline is very popular in Vim (and with Evil users), but I much prefer
   [[https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/smart-mode-line][smart-mode-line]]. It's compatible with just about anything you can imagine,
   and it's easy to set up.

   
*** =smart-mode-line=
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (req-package smart-mode-line
                   :requires nyan-mode
                   :ensure smart-mode-line
                   :init (sml/setup))    
    #+END_SRC

*** =nyan-mode=
    [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode][nyan-mode]] is a goofy way to display one's location in a file.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (req-package nyan-mode
               :ensure nyan-mode
               :init
               (progn
                 (nyan-mode)
                 (setq nyan-wavy-trail t))
               :config (nyan-start-animation))    
    #+END_SRC

*** =powerline=
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (req-package powerline)
    #+END_SRC
    
** Faces
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package faces
                  :config
                  (progn
                    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :family "DejaVu Sans Mono")
                    (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 120)))   
   #+END_SRC

** Cleanup
   Who wants all that toolbars and scrollbars noise?
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package scroll-bar
                  :config
                  (scroll-bar-mode -1))
     
     (req-package tool-bar
                  :config
                  (tool-bar-mode -1))
     
     (req-package menu-bar
                  :config
                  (menu-bar-mode -1))   
   #+END_SRC

   I also use [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DiminishedModes][diminish]] to clean up the modeline.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package diminish
                  :ensure diminish)
     
     (req-package server
                  :diminish (server-buffer-clients . ""))
   #+END_SRC

* IDE
  A few conveniences that I like to have in all my =prog-mode= buffers.

** Flycheck
   Flycheck has helped me write more programs than I'm totally
   comfortable admitting.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package flycheck
       :ensure flycheck
       :diminish (global-flycheck-mode . " ✓ ")
       :config
       (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-flycheck-mode))

     (req-package helm-flycheck
       :commands helm-flycheck
       :requires flycheck
       :config
       (bind-key "C-c ! h"
                 'helm-flycheck
                 flycheck-mode-map))
   #+END_SRC

** Magit
   The only git wrapper that matters.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package magit
       :diminish magit-auto-revert-mode)
   #+END_SRC

** Line Numbers
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package linum
       :config
       (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook
                 '(lambda () (linum-mode 1))))   
   #+END_SRC

*** Relative Line Numbers
    I was a little spoiled by this feature in Vim, and not having it
    just doesn't sit well with me.

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (req-package linum-relative
        :init (setq linum-relative-current-symbol ""))
    #+END_SRC

** Delimiters
   I like my delimiters matched and visually distinct. I used [[https://bitbucket.org/kovisoft/paredit][paredit]] for a
   long time, but I'm currently experimenting with [[https://github.com/Fuco1/smartparens][smartparens]]. As for the
   visual element, I quite like [[https://github.com/jlr/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]].

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package smartparens-config
       :ensure smartparens
       :diminish (smartparens-mode . "()")
       :init (smartparens-global-mode t))

     (req-package rainbow-delimiters
       :config
       (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-delimiters-mode))
   #+END_SRC

** Colors
   I've had to work with colors in a fair bit of code, so having them displayed
   in buffer is convenient.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package rainbow-mode
       :diminish (rainbow-mode . "")
       :config (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'rainbow-mode))
   #+END_SRC
   
   There's also an interesting mode for uniquely coloring identifiers in code
   so that they are easy to scan for. It's still a bit iffy, but it's fun to
   try.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package color-identifiers-mode
       :diminish (color-identifiers-mode . "")
       :init
       (setq color-identifiers:num-colors 50)
       :config
       (progn
         (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'color-identifiers-mode)
         (add-hook 'ruby-mode-hook 'color-identifiers-mode)))
   #+END_SRC
 
** Completion
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package auto-complete-config
       :ensure auto-complete
       :init
       (progn
         (ac-config-default)
         (setq ac-auto-start 3))
       :config
       (progn
         (require 'ac-math)
         (require 'auto-complete-auctex)))

                 (lambda ()
                   (setq mode-name " ξ ")))) 
   #+END_SRC

** LaTeX
   All you need is AUCTeX, end of story.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package tex-site
       :ensure auctex
       :requires auto-complete-config)

     (req-package ac-math
       :requires auto-complete-config)

     (req-package auto-complete-auctex
       :requires auto-complete-config)
   #+END_SRC
 
** R
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package ess-site
       :ensure ess)
   #+END_SRC

** Idris
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package idris-mode)
   #+END_SRC
   
* Annoyances
  Fixing a couple of gripes I have with Emacs.

** Exec path
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package exec-path-from-shell
       :init
       (when (memq window-system '(mac ns))
         (exec-path-from-shell-initialize)))
   #+END_SRC

** Backups and Autosave Files
   These things end up everywhere, so let's stick them all in a temporary
   directory.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package files
       :init
       (progn
         (setq backup-directory-alist
               `((".*" . ,temporary-file-directory)))
         (setq auto-save-file-name-transforms
               `((".*" ,temporary-file-directory t)))))
   #+END_SRC

** Questions
   Keep it short.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (defalias 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
   #+END_SRC

** Customizations
   [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/cus-edit%2B.el][cus-edit+]] is a really handy way to keep your customizations up to
   date, especially if you set your =custom-file=.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (req-package cus-edit+
       :init (customize-toggle-outside-change-updates))
   #+END_SRC

* Fulfill Requirements
  At long last we need only call the following function to send =req-package= on
  its merry way.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (req-package-finish)
  #+END_SRC
